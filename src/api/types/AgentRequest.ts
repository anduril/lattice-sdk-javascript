 * Response streamed to an agent containing task actions to perform.
 *
 * This message is streamed from Tasks API to agents and contains one of three
 * possible requests: execute a task, cancel a task, or complete a task. The agent
 * should process these requests according to its capabilities and report status
 * updates back to Tasks API using the UpdateStatus endpoint.
 *
 * Multiple responses may be sent for different tasks, and the agent should maintain
 * the connection to receive ongoing task requests. The connection may also be used
 * for heartbeat messages to ensure the agent is still responsive.
