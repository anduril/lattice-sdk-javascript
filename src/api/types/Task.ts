/**
 * A task represents a structured unit of work that can be assigned to an agent for execution.
 *
 *  Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of work assignment in the Lattice.
 *  Each task has a unique identifier, a specification defining what needs to be done,
 *  status information tracking its progress, and various metadata facilitating its lifecycle management.
 *
 *  Tasks can be related to each other, through parent-child relationships, assigned to
 *  specific agents, and tracked through a well-defined state machine from creation to completion.
 *  They support rich status reporting, including progress updates, error handling, and results.
